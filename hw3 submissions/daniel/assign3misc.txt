The CS Tech Support page has instructions on the FAQ page:

On the link "MySQL", you find the following:
------------------------------
To log into your mysql account, follow these steps:
    Log into or ssh to cslinux.cs.utep.edu, using your MINERS credentials.
    Open a command terminal.
    # mysql -u {username} -h earth -p
Once you log into cslinux.cs.utep.edu, follow these steps to change your password:
    # mysql -u {username} -h earth -p
    Enter your current mysql password.
    # SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('secretcode');
    Exit and test your password.

I personally connect using Putty. 
We found out that to you need to VPN to UTEP even if you're already at UTEP using utepsecure wifi.
If you are connected directly with an internet wire, you don't need VPN.
On earth your username is the same as your miners username.
Your default password is cs5339!<miners username>.
Please change your password as instructed above.

In the PHP file, you can use:
$user="<UTEP user name>";
$hn="earth.cs.utep.edu";
$un="$user";
$db="$user";
$pw="cs5339!$user";?   // or whatever password you've changed to
?
The database cannot be accessed with PhpMyAdmin.
